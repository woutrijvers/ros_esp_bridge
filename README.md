# Arduino/ESP32 Motor Controller

This is forked from https://github.com/joshnewans/ros_arduino_bridge. Check here for more info
This version has an option to use a ESP32

TODO
- Make a new readme
- Add instructions/tutorial


## Functionality

The main functionality provided is to receive motor speed requests over a serial connection, and provide encoder feedback.
The original code has provisions for other features - e.g. read/write of digital/analog pins, servo control, but I've never used them.

The main commands to know are

- `e` - Motor responds with current encoder counts for each motor
- `r` - Reset encoder values
- `o <PWM1> <PWM2>` - Set the raw PWM speed of each motor (-255 to 255)
- `m <Spd1> <Spd2>` - Set the closed-loop speed of each motor in *counts per loop* (Default loop rate is 30, so `(counts per sec)/30`
- `p <Kp> <Kd> <Ki> <Ko>` - Update the PID parameters


## Gotchas

Some quick things to note

- There is an auto timeout (default 2s) so you need to keep sending commands for it to keep moving
- PID parameter order is PDI (?)
- Motor speed is in counts per loop
- Default baud rate 57600
- Needs carriage return (CR)
- Make sure serial is enabled (user in dialout group)
- Check out the original readme for more
